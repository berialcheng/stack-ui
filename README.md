It relay on the Stackoverflow's RESTful API to do the advance search work, so it is limited by the requests quota. Although for routine purpose query, it should be sufficient.

It is pure Angularjs application with no backend support required, that means you could easily build your own application at local site if you want. Alternative you could just use my deployment [http://www.berialcheng.com/stack-ui/](http://www.berialcheng.com/stack-ui/)

## Roadmap
1. History view for query
2. Docker image support
3. Advanced tag query
4. Auto completion while search content
